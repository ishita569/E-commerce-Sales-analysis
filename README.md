# E-commerce Sales Analytics (SQL + Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes e-commerce sales data using SQL for data cleaning and analysis, and Power BI for interactive dashboards and business insights.

The goal was to identify revenue drivers, customer purchasing patterns,
product concentration (Pareto analysis), and geographic performance.

## Tools Used
- MySQL
- Power BI
- SQL (CTEs, window functions)
- DAX

## Key Analyses (SQL)
- Revenue & sales trends (monthly, quarterly)
- Average Order Value (AOV)
- Pareto (80/20) product analysis
- High-volume vs high-value products
- City-level performance
- Time-of-day and hourly demand patterns

## Power BI Dashboard
The dashboard consists of 3 pages:
1. **Executive Overview** – KPIs, revenue trends, category contribution
2. **Product & Revenue Drivers** – Top products, Pareto analysis, price vs quantity
3. **Geography & Timing** – City performance, peak hours, best vs worst cities
